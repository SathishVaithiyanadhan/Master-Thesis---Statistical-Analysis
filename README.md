# Statistical analysis of systematic differences in the calculated pollutant concentrations of the models ECMWF / CAMS (Regional Reanalysis) and Polyphemus / DLR


Thesis Title: Statistical analysis of systematic differences in the calculated pollutant concentrations of the models ECMWF / CAMS (Regional Reanalysis) and Polyphemus / DLR


Files added: The R scripts and thesis results (maps and plots) are attached in the repository for reference.

R scripts:
The R scipts are directly downloadable from the repository. All the scripts are commented well and easy to understand.

Maps and plots: 
The Result maps and plots are added as zip files due to size constrains. They are easily downloadable as zip files. All the results from each statistical analyses are clearly seperated in different folders for easy understanding. 

Three different result folders: 1) Model-model-station comparison results
                                2) Model-model comparison results
                                3) Predictive analysis and feature importance results
                                
Thank you!
